<p>It's been a crazy year, and it's even crazier to think that people are still following the same Tech roadmap that was made years ago (it wasn't that relevant at that time too). The Tech landscape is evolving at an unprecedented pace, leaving behind the antiquated notions of job security based solely on technical proficiency. With the looming specter of AI encroaching on traditional tech roles (as evidenced by the ominous LinkedIn feed), it's high time we acknowledge that merely mastering the technical ropes no longer guarantees a spot in the game, let alone a lasting career.</p>

<p>Reflecting back on my own, short but eventful, journey into software developer, I was always given the tip to become a master of one programming language. When I used to go up the internet to learn, everybody was busy selling Tech Roadmaps or their Javascript course. While these resources certainly had their merits, they largely overlooked the essential skills and qualities necessary for true growth as a software developer. I come from a country which is producing million and millions of software engineers every year. Surely just learnign all the syntax of a language can not guarantee a good career for all of them.</p>

<p>There are a lot of skills that I have learnt while doing my job that I have realised are so important to grow as a Software Developer. Analytical and critical thinking is something every software engineer should be focusing on. We are not here in this job to just reverse a binary tree(Always remember that we are here to add value to the shareholders).</p>

<p>One of my manager from my first job had said me that in time I will figure out that I will spend more time outside of coding in my job and I should learn how to be good at it. It didn't hit me at that point in time but over time I have realised that I have spent much time asking the 'why', 'how', 'what' and 'where' questions related to any code that I am going to write or change. You should realise your work should bring the best value to everyone invloved. Understanding the problem that you are trying to solve to the point and coming up with a solution (it's also about learning that no solution is a correct or wrong, it's just something which fits the requirements the best); if you have your ideas organized and you can communicate it properly to the people involved, then you will always remain at an advantage.</p>

<p>Another core skill that often gets overlooked is the technical writing aspect. As a software developers, we look at a lot of technical documents, whether it be high level design or low level design or maybe a POC findings. A sound developer produces sound documents. Documents are the best way to put your idea across the board and even get visibility for the working that you are carrying out.</p>

<p>Software Developers have to be very fast at learning. A lot of jobs that I see demand that the person gets up to the speed with the technologies that they are using. One cannot be proficient in every technology that exist but should know the basics to leverage them for their use. This also applies to the rising Gen AI tools that are coming up. It's unlikely (don't take up my word, nobody can predict the future) that most of the jobs will be eaten by the AI but that shouldn't really mean we lag behind. AI tools are right now very immature at solving complex problems but still can be leveraged to solve smaller ones or carry out few tasks for you. It agains require the right thinking to get the best out of all the tools and not just syntax knowledge.</p>

<p>Although tech jobs have met a decent decline in past couple of years, I still see there's a good demand of skilled all round developers. It might be true that lower or less skilled jobs have been cleared and it makes it more evident that just knowing how to code out few lines wouldn't really help anymore. I have been myself on the journey to improve myself. Hopefully, the markets will change and people will soon focus all round learning.</p>
